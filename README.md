# Inform yourself

# Motivation
Our motivaton was to help people determine when a source (in this case graphs) may be misleading

# Tech/framework used
This project was built using React

# What it does
This project is a quiz with the purpose of testing the user's ability to recognize misleading information

# Challenges we ran
Some of the challenges we ran in to were the addition of different images on the quiz, finding the right formatting of the quiz itself and ending screen after completing the test

# What we learned
We learned a lot about javascript, HTML, and CSS. Since this was our first time using react, we didn't know what to expect about this whole project. But, we learned all about formatting and designing a website, as well as finding ways to use REACT to create something that can be useful in our lives
